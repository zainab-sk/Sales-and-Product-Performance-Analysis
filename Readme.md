# üõçÔ∏è Sales and Product Performance Analysis

This project explores **sales and product performance** in an e-commerce business using real multi-table data.  
The goal is to gain insights into **regional sales trends, payment preferences, seasonal patterns, and product performance**.

## üöÄ Workflow Overview

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Collection & Database Setup

- **Five raw CSVs** from the Kaggle ‚ÄúEcommerce Order & Supply Chain Dataset‚Äù were used  
  (`orders`, `order_items`, `products`, `customers`, `payments`).
- Imported these files into a **SQL database** for easier relational queries.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Queried the database in Python using **pandas + SQLAlchemy**.
- Performed **data cleaning**:
  - Removed null / duplicate rows,
  - Converted date columns to datetime,
  - Ensured numeric columns had correct data types.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Building a Unified Dataset

- **Joined multiple tables** (orders, order items, customers, payments, products) to create a single **analysis-ready dataframe**.
- Selected only the columns necessary for sales performance analytics.
- Saved this **curated dataframe back to the database** for future use.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Sales & Product Performance Analysis

Key analyses and visualisations included:

- **Top product categories** by total sales.
- **Sales trends by year and by month**, identifying seasonal patterns.
- **Average delivery days** by state.
- **Most popular payment methods**.
- **Regions (Brazilian states)** generating the highest number of orders.
- **Most sold product in each state**.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Visualisation

- Plotted insights using:
  - **Matplotlib & Seaborn** for Python charts,
  - **Tableau** dashboards to create interactive KPIs and maps.

---

## üìä Key Insights

- **S√£o Paulo (SP)** drives the highest order volume (~37k orders), followed by **Rio de Janeiro (RJ)** and **Minas Gerais (MG)**.
- **Credit card** is the dominant payment method.
- **Sales is low in last quarter**, indicating strong year-end seasonality.
- Some states exhibit **longer average delivery times**, highlighting potential supply chain optimization opportunities.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Python**: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, SQLAlchemy
- **Database**: SQLite (or your chosen SQL engine)
- **Visualisation**: Tableau
